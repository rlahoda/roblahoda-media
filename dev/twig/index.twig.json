I knew I wanted to be a photographer. Starting with sports photography in high school I decided that photojournalism was the way to go. I graduated from the Ohio University School of Visual Communication program having being taught by Pulitzer Prize winners, National Geographic photographers and many other incredible experts in the field. Since graduation, I've expanded the work I do, but it still comes back to photography.",

As I experimented with different video editing programs to create my slideshows, I decided to try to use those programs to create actual videos. Thus was born my love of video production. While completing my photojournalism degree, I started taking video producion classes so I was able to stick around for 1 more year and earn the video degree on top of my photography degree. Since then I've worked doing a variety of video production, including single-camera narrative, interview-based, sports, live event recording and other projects. I've had lots of fun travelling around the world for projects to help my clients tell their stories the most effectively.",

Not just a little drizzle or something, this was a full-on downpour at times. In fact, if you watch closely during this video at the end when racers are coming into the finish it kinda looks like they are different days because some shots are dry and sunny and others are heavy rain, but those shots were within an hour of each other. That's how crazy the rain was this year.&nbsp; Once again, I wanted to add a new element into the mix. This year it was a mini jib. I went with the Genustech Mini Jib because I was looking for something compact, lightweight and well built. The jib worked way better than I could have imagined it would.

After the crazy adventure of the first year, I came back with a better idea of what I was getting into and what I needed to do. In addition, I had a few new tricks up my sleeve. The first was that I switched from shooting with my tape-based HDV camera to a DSLR. I rented a Nikon D800 from Lensrentals.com and used that as my primary camera throughout the weekend. I also added a GoPro as a secondary camera which allowed me to get some pretty great shots of the racers in motion. One of my favorite shots was when I put the GoPro on the back of my car and paced near a racer. I also added a camera slider to give me a variety of camera moves I wasn't able to achieve previously. Instead of going with a standard one on rails, I decided to go with the CineMover which is more a mini dolly than a slider. The cool thing with the CineMover is that you can use it on anything that is flat so I brought a metal sawhorse and a piece of vinyl  fence post to use for the sliding moves. Between the two I was able to capture higher and lower moves. Having the Cinemover added a lot to the impact of the video.",

My client wanted something that would show the fun and excitement of the race weekend as well as show off the professional triathletes who came to race. This meant that when shooting the big half-iron distance race on Sunday I needed to capture as much as I could at the swim site and then race ahead of the pack to capture the leaders as they went along the course.

        "caption": "After working hard on the recap video, I came back home and got to work on producing a promotional video for Triple-T with the footage I shot. I decided to ask for some volunteers to be interviewed in the Columbus area and was able to connect with three. My goal was to weave their stories throughout the video to give the audience a feel for what it takes to complete the race.",

        "caption": "It started as a simple request, but has grown to be one of my favorite events to film each year. The American Triple-T is a three-day triathlon series in southern Ohio. This intense race has been challenging racers for years with it's steep climbs and challenging terrain. This first year was a blur of running around trying to film the racers as the covered over a hundred miles of racing that weekend. In addition, I would go back to my room and spend hours capturing and editing my footage. At the end of the race during the awards ceremony I played this video made up of footage from all three days of racing. It was an intense effort made even more challenging by the fact that I was filming the event on my Sony HDV camera. So once I was done filming I still had a real-time capture ahead before I could start to work with the footage.",
